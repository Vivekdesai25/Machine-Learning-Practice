# Machine Learning Practice

This repository contains my personal practice work in the field of Machine Learning.

It serves as a space where I explore different machine learning concepts, algorithms, and techniques by implementing them through hands-on coding. The goal is to build a strong understanding of how machine learning works in practice, beyond just theory.

The repository includes:
- Well-organized Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step implementation of algorithms
- Python scripts for model training, testing, and evaluation
- Experimentation with real and sample datasets
- Notes and comments to explain the logic and thought process behind the code

Whether it's basic models like linear regression or more complex ones like decision trees and support vector machines, I use this repo to practice and improve continuously.

This is a learning-focused project, and I keep updating it as I learn new techniques, tools, and approaches in the ML domain.
